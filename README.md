# A-Star-Search-Algorithm

## Project Description
<b> Project Title: </b> Implemented A* search algorithm to solve a maze problem

This project implements an A* search algorithm to solve a treasure hunt problem in a virtual hexagonal grid environment. The objective is to compute the most cost-efficient path that collects all treasures while accounting for dynamic conditions introduced by traps, rewards, and obstacles.

Each movement incurs a cost influenced by step and energy multipliers, which change based on interactions with specific grid cells. The program utilizes a consistent and admissible heuristic (hexagonal Manhattan distance) to guide the search, ensuring optimal pathfinding in a non-uniform cost space.

### The solution includes:

- A Python-based implementation of the algorithm
- A plotted map visualization of the path taken
- Console output summarizing the optimal route and cost metrics

This project was developed for the CSC3206 Artificial Intelligence course and demonstrates practical skills in heuristic search, pathfinding under constraints, and adaptive cost modeling.
